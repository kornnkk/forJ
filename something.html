        <h1> Hii J, was wondering something. </h1>
        <p> so, diba we've had like something for a while, but like it never really beacame official.
            theres just this feeling. this aching feeling, that longing to be with you.

            idk how to do this but, i would like to take our thing a bit further, i wanna commit to this. i know i may not be perfect, but i promise that i will try my best.
            i will try my best with this and make this last. lets inspire another to do better in school, i have much more to say, but diko knows what else to type here so poem (from chatgpt nalang ilalagay ko). hehe
        </p> <hr>
       <pre> 
        In friendship's embrace, love's ember grew,
        Now I confess, I want to be with you.
        Beyond companionship, let's take the leap,
        Will you be mine, in love's secret keep?
